                        <p>Hello there! I'm Naim Kim, a Computer Science major at HGU passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Originally from Seoul, South Korea, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology, creativity, and innovation.</p>
                        <p>My journey in computer science began during high school when I developed my first website for a local community project. Since then, I've immersed myself in various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies, continually expanding my knowledge and skills.</p>
                        <p>During my time at HGU, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from developing web applications to exploring artificial intelligence and machine learning. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy tackling complex challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
                        <p>Beyond coding, I'm passionate about staying updated with the latest industry trends, attending tech meetups, and contributing to open-source projects. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, playing the guitar, or experimenting in the kitchen.</p>
                        <p>I'm currently seeking internships or opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or just chat about all things tech!</p>
